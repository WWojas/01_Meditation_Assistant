# React app for Medidation Assistants

This app is aimed at helping people interested in enhancing their meditation skills with increasing their cognitive focus by combining the meditation itself with chakra music, targeted
at specific body parts.

Thanks to introducing interval bell along with uploaded chakra soundtracks users can both keep track of their meditation time as well as improve their present focus by following along chakra sound waves which immensely enhance focus via implementing a leading 432Hz soundwave.
